;;Ex19: Design the following function:
;; rel-rec-sequence: Number Number -> Rectangle
;; Takes two numbers and returns a solid blue rectangle, where the first 
;; number is the width of the rectangle, and the second number is the 
;; proportion of width and height of the rectangle to be produced 
;;(i.e. height = width * proportion).


;; DATA DEFINITIONS: none
;; rel-rec-sequence: Number Number -> Rectangle   
;; GIVEN:Width of the Rectangle and Proportion of height to width
;; RETURNS: Rectangle with dimensions height * width
;; EXAMPLES: (rel-rec-sequence 10 4)=> Rectangle with width 10 and height 40
;; DESIGN STRATEGY: Domain Knowledge
